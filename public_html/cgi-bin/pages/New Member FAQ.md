#### How much of a time commitment is joining Pep Band?

During the football season, marching members and color guard can expect 6-8 hours of rehearsal (drill, music) per week. Stands members can expect 1 hour of rehearsal (music) per week. Everyone is expected to attend the approximately 5 home games on Saturdays across August through November. Games will generally take 3-4 hours from reporting time to when you are free.

During the basketball season, everyone can expect 2 hours of rehearsal (music) per week. Games are more frequent, usually 2-3 per week. Color Guard does not perform at basketball games.

#### Can I play a sport and still be in Pep Band?

This largely depends on the sport, but in the vast majority of cases, the answer will be yes. If you're marching, you will most likely have to miss some drill rehearsals and work with us to plan your schedule. If you're just playing in the stands with us, however, this is a much smaller time commitment, and you should be able to work us into just about any schedule. Please email [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu) to try and figure out your schedule for sports and other activity conflicts.

#### Are there instruments available to borrow?

The Pep Band has a limited number of instruments available for members to borrow. If we do not have one for you, we will work with other music groups at the school to try and find one for you. For specific information on which instruments are available, please email [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu).

#### I don't know how to march. Is that a problem?

Absolutely not! A large part of band camp will be dedicated to teaching marching basics. As long as you're willing to cooperate and work at it, it shouldn't be a problem. We are open to members of all skill level.

--

#### I already know how to march. Do I need to attend Band Camp?

Yes! We would like to make sure everyone in our marching band has a uniform marching style. Plus, we learn show music and drill during band camp, so it is necessary for every marching member to attend.

--

#### How "extreme" is this marching band?

The WPI Pep Band is a real, non-competitive marching band that does real shows and plays real music; however, that does not mean that we take ourselves too seriously. We make sure that we are focused at rehearsals, but there is still room for fun. There is no intense physical conditioning associated with this ensemble.

### Band Camp
---

#### What is band camp?

Band camp is for marching members and color guard only. During this time, we learn a good deal of show music and drill. Itâ€™s also great fun with themed dress up days and other fun activities. *This is mandatory for all marching members and color guard.* 

--

#### When is band camp?
Band Camp typically occurs during the week preceding New Student Orientation. Members living in on-campus housing will move in on the morning of the first day, and Band Camp will begin that afternoon. There are no costs associated with moving in early for band camp. A detailed [schedule](Events) with exact dates will be posted as the date approaches.

--

#### Will food be provided during band camp?
The Pep Band will provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner during band camp. There will be a small fee (~$10) for meals. In addition to being cheap, these meals are also a great time to get acquainted with your fellow band members! Meals will be in small groups at the houses of upperclassmen. If you have any dietary restrictions, please email [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu).
