### How do I sign up?
To sign up, please email the officers at [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu) with your name, WPI student ID number, and instrument (or color guard!). In your email please indicate whether or not you would like to do marching band or just stands. If you would like to participate in the marching band, please send your email by June 19, 2015. Applications for stands are open year round. There are no auditions for either group.

### What is Band Camp?
Band camp is for marching members only. During this time, we learn a good deal of show music and drill. Itâ€™s also great fun with themed dress up days and other fun activities. This is mandatory for all marching members.  

### When is Band Camp?
Band Camp typically occurs during the week preceding New Student Orientation. Members living in on-campus housing will move in on the morning of the first day, and Band Camp will begin in the afternoon. There are no costs associated with moving in early for band camp. A detailed schedule with exact dates will be posted as the date approaches.

### Will food be provided during band camp?
The Pep Band will provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner during band camp. There will be a $10 fee for meals. In addition to being cheap, these meals are also a great time to get acquainted with your fellow band members! If you have any dietary restrictions, please email [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu).

### Can I play a sport and still be in Pep Band?
This largely depends on the sport, but in the vast majority of cases, the answer will be yes. If you're marching, you will most likely have to miss some Pep Band practices and work with us to plan your schedule.If you're just playing in the stands with us, however, this is a much smaller time commitment, and you should be able to work us into just about any schedule. Please email [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu) to try and figure out your schedule for sports and other activity conflicts.

### Do you have instruments for me to borrow?
The Pep Band has a limited number of instruments available for members to borrow. If we do not have one for you, we will work with other music groups at the school to try and find one for you. For specific information on which instruments are available, please e-mail [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu).

### I don't know how to march. Is that a problem?
Absolutely not! A large part of band camp will be dedicated to teaching marching basics. As long as you're willing to cooperate and work at it, it shouldn't be a problem. We are open to members of all skill level.

### I already know how to march. Do I need to attend Band Camp?
Yes! We would like to make sure everyone in our marching band has a uniform marching style. Plus, we learn show music and drill during band camp, so it is necessary for every marching member to attend.

### What about color guard?
Yes! We love our color guard! Our guard performs with the marching band in the fall and does an indoor show in the winter. We are open to members of all skill level, even if that means you have no experience.

### How "extreme" is this marching band?
The WPI Pep Band is a real, non-competitive marching band that does real shows and plays real music; however, that does not mean that we take ourselves too seriously. We make sure that we are focused at rehearsals, but there is still room for fun. There is no intense physical conditioning associated with this ensemble.
