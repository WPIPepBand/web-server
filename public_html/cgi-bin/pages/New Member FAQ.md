### How do I sign up?
This depends on whether you will be marching with us or not. If you're going to be marching, then we'll just need you to e-mail [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu) confirming that you will in fact be joining so that we can get you permission to move in early. In order to secure a spot, you must let us know that you will be marching by **June 20th, 2013** (That's a Friday). If you're not going to be marching, then you don't need to come to Band Camp, and you don't need to move in early, so all you have to do is show up to the first (non-marching) rehearsal. You can either e-mail us and tell us to put you on the mailing list so you'll get a reminder, or you can just check the web page as fall approaches to find the date of the first rehearsal.

### What is Band Camp?
Contrary to what you may have learned from the incredibly educational *American Pie* movies, Band Camp does not occur in the back woods and there are no counselors. Band Camp is simply four days of intense rehearsals interspersed with intense fun. We will teach marching basics and begin to learn our field show, and schedule various fun and exciting activities as well. You will be required to attend Band Camp if you plan on marching with the WPI Pep Band.

### When is Band Camp?
Band Camp typically occurs during the four days preceding New Student Orientation. Members living in on-campus housing will move in on the morning of the first day, and Band Camp will begin in the afternoon. All members who are marching are required to attend. Those that are only playing in the stands do not need to attend. A detailed schedule will be posted as the date approaches.

### Will food be provided during band camp? 
The Pep Band will provide meals during band camp. However, due to recent budget cuts there will be a small fee ($10) to cover meals. In addition to being cheap, these meals are also a great time to get acquainted with your fellow band members!

### What are the costs associated with joining Pep Band?
That would depend on what part of the band you're in. All instrumentalists will need a Pep Band polo shirt which costs $15. All marchers will need appropriate shoes and gloves (black shoes and gloves for instrumentalists, black shoes and black fingerless gloves for the color guard members). The cost for these two things is roughly $30. There is also a $10 fee for band camp to cover meal costs, which only applies to marchers.

### How much of a time commitment is joining Pep Band?
That depends on whether you're marching or just playing in the stands. If you're just playing in the stands with us, then we'll have stands music rehearsal for an hour about once a week. If you're marching, then you should plan on an average of 6-8 hours a week of rehearsal. There are generally five home football games per year, all on Saturday.

During basketball season, practices are less frequent and games are much more frequent. We generally play at two to three games per week (each one lasting about 2 hours).

### Can I play a sport and still be in Pep Band?
This largely depends on the sport, but in the vast majority of cases, the answer will be yes. If you're marching, you will most likely have to miss some Pep Band practices and work with us to plan your schedule, but it's usually nothing we can't work around. If you're just playing in the stands with us, however, this is a much smaller time commitment, and you should be able to work us into just about any schedule.

### Do you have a(n) [insert instrument here] for me to borrow?
The Pep Band has a limited number of instruments available for members to borrow. If we do not have one for you to borrow, we will work with you to find you an instrument. In some cases this means borrowing an instrument from the Music Association, and in some cases it may mean hunting for a cheap one on eBay, but we will do our best to get everybody an appropriate instrument. For specific information on which instruments are available, please e-mail [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu).

### I don't know how to march. Is that a problem?
Absolutely not. A large part of band camp will be dedicated to teaching marching basics. As long as you're willing to cooperate and work at it, it shouldn't be a problem.

### I already know how to march. Do I need to attend Band Camp?
Yes. While you may be an incredibly competent marcher, there are many different styles of marching taught by different high schools, and it will be necessary to 'unlearn' your style and learn the style that we use. Plus, a little practice never hurt anybody.

### I was in a marching band in high school, but we just kind of stood there and only marched around a little bit. Is that what this is like?
No. We do march for real, meaning marching and playing *at the same time*, pretty much all the time. This is tough stuff and, believe it or not, requires some hard work. Please look at the time commitment question above to make sure you know what you're in for. That being said, we try not to take ourselves too seriously. We're going to work hard so that we can put on an awesome show, but we also try to inject some fun into every rehearsal.

### I'm from a crazily competitive marching band, SIR! We won the national championship 4,000 years in a row and I was the drum major of it, so I'm awesome, SIR!
First of all, that's not a question. Second of all, we're very proud that you're awesome, but the culture here may be a little different than you're used to. There will not be any yelling, screaming, self-esteem busting, push-ups, running laps, or other uber-marching-band-esque things. Sure, we work hard and we want to put on a great show, but let's be honest with ourselves: the WPI Pep Band is not going to be winning any national championships anytime soon, and nor do we want to. We're here first and foremost to have a good time, get the crowd excited, and spread around some pep.
