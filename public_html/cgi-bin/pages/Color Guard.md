### Don't play an instrument? Why not join Color Guard?

WPI's Color Guard is open to all levels of experience. Everyone from "I have been a member of finalist groups in the World Class level of Winter Guard International" to "What's a flag?" is welcome to join!


#### So, what exactly is the Color Guard?
The Color Guard is the purely visual element of our shows. We spin work, also known as the carriage, written by our Color Guard Captain to reflect the musicality of the show. Our color guard spins 5.5ft flags, 32in rifles, and swing flags on the field while marching and/or dancing as the band plays and marches as well.

#### Sounds cool, but I'm going to have a busy summer/A-term. Is there another chance for me to spin?
Absolutely! WPI Pep Band also has its very own Winter Guard! The Winter Guard performs during half time of basketball games, doing shorter, more complex routines to recorded music or to the band playing a song from their repertoire. Winter Guard typically runs from mid-November through late mid-February.
