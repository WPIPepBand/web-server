### You don’t have to play an instrument to be in the Pep Band. Come and join the WPI Color Guard!

### So, what exactly is the Color Guard?
Color Guard enhances the visual side of a marching show with flag and weapon work to set to the band’s music which incorporates a dance element to the show. The work is usually written by the Color Guard Captain or by other experienced guard members and reflects the musicality of the show. Our color guard spins 6ft flags, and 32in rifles. We do not spin sabre at this time but occasionally use swing flags and chain flags to add some flare to the show. 

### What if I’ve never done Color Guard before?
WPI's Color Guard is open to all levels of experience. People who have never even heard of color guard before are welcome to join and learn. The level of guard work in our show depends on who is writing it but usually stays at a beginner to intermediate level.  

### Sounds cool, but I'm going to have a busy summer/A-term. Is there another chance for me to spin?

Along with the marching show the Color Guard also has a Winter Guard show during basketball season. The shorter routine is performed during half time of basketball games to either recorded music or stands songs played by the pep band. Winter Guard typically runs from mid-November through late mid-February.
