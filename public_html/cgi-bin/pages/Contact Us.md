**Major:** Chemical Engineering/ Mechanical Engineering

**Class year:** 2020

**Position:** President

-At the end of winter break last year when a bunch of people from my floor made a giant blanket fort in my room
-Dumb shenanigans with the low brass section during/after rehearsal (Christmas is in October, and again in November, right?)

**What's a fun fact about you?**
Backpacking is one of my favorite activities! I’ve hiked through the White Mountains more times than I’d like to admit, including a trail run up Mt. Washington (1 hr 55 min from base to summit), and hiked the Grand Canyon rim-rim-rim. 

**What other organizations are you involved in?**
Concert band, plus spending a fair amount of time in the machine shops

**If you were any kind of pepper what kind would you be and why?**
Chili pepper! I’m small, always chilly, and tend to use a lot of spice in my cooking.

**Anything else?**
The dog’s name is Levi, I bring him on adventures hiking and trail running!
