#### The Basics:
The WPI Pep Band has 3 forms of membership:

| Marching | Stands | Color Guard |
|----------|--------|-------------|

**The band welcomes everyone** -- Don't be discouraged if you've never played, marched, or spun before; we can help you learn! See the [New Member FAQ](New%20Member%20FAQ) for more information about time commitments and other useful information.

#### Credit:
The Pep Band also offers physical education credit for those participating in football and/or basketball season. Participation in Pep Band for four seasons will therefore fulfill your university physical education requirement. Despite being available for academic credit, rehearsals and performances are still very casual and loads of fun.

To help prepare the halftime show, we will be holding a band camp from **August 14th - 17th**, which is immediately before New Student Orientation. Drumline members should arrive a day early, **August 13th**, for part auditions. If you will be joining us as a marching member, you will be required to attend. We will need you to let us know whether you are interested in marching with us by **Saturday, July 1st**, in order to prepare for your arrival and band camp.

Currently, we are looking for new members for football season! Please feel free to contact the officer board at [pepoff@wpi.edu](mailto:pepoff@wpi.edu) if you have any questions or you are interested in joining us for football or basketball season.
